title: Lumen 1.0
---

Let's talk about Lumen! That's one of my projects I recently finished (actually, the first version). The idea is to have a homemade RGB lamp I could control wireless. So, in this article I will briefly present to you components and implementation details of the project.

You're absolutely free to use the content of this article to inspire your own project! :-)

##Components
For this first version in decided to use some simple components.

* [Arduino Pro Mini](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini) (ATMega328 16Mhz 5v)
* Bluetooth module (HC-06 RS232)
* 3 x TIP122
* 3 x 1k&Omega;
* 2 x 10&Omega;, 1 x 3.9&Omega; and 1 x 8.2&Omega; (should be 2W)
* 9v DC power

###Optional
Because I make the choice to use a Pro Mini, I also have to buy an FTDI to connect the board to my computer.

* [FTDI Basic 5v](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716)

##Electronic
As I said, I decided to build a simple electronic system. First, because my skills in electronic are very limited, and also because it's mainly a prototype and I'm more interested about the programming side.

So basically, this is the circuit.

Be careful this circuit use a 3.3v version of the Arduino. You could have to adapt it for a 5v version.

##Program
So, we have the electronic structure, now we need the source code to put inside the Arduino to get remote control. It's a classical loop with two possible actions `r` or `w` (read or write).

All commands are ending by a `#`. We've two basic commands :

* `r#`
* `wXXX XXX XXX#` where `XXX` are digital values beetween 0 and 255

The first one return the current value of the RGB lamp. The other set the lamp to the given RGB value.

There is the full source code.

###The Bluetooth module (HC-06)
I encountered a lot of problems with the HC-06 module. I currently do not explain why... but I caution you : This cheap module can make you lose your time!

The Bluetooth module of my computer seem to be incompatible with the HC-06. Fortunately, my Galaxy Tab is able to correctly communicate with this module.

####Settings
You can also want to change the device name or customize other options of the module (the baud rate for example). To do this I suggest that you take a look [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Modify-The-HC-05-Bluetooth-Module-Defaults-Using-A/) (for the circuit) and [here](http://mcuoneclipse.com/2013/06/19/using-the-hc-06-bluetooth-module/) (for commands to used).

##Improvements
This version is currently working, but there are some problems about the electronic part. In fact, the circuit I build is notably bad :-\ There is a massive loss of power in resistors and transistors level.

The solution is to build a new circuit with [pulsed LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_circuit#Pulsed_LED_operation) to exploit the [persistence of vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision). I do not detail this here, but you can find a lot of resources about it on Google.
